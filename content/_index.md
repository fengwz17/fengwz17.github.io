# About Me {#about-me}

I'm a Ph.D student at the [Verification of System Software Group](https://versys.ios.ac.cn/) in the [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.iscas.ac.cn) (ISCAS), supervised by [Prof. Lijun Zhang](https://tis.ios.ac.cn/people/lijun-zhang/) and [Prof. Zhilin Wu](https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~wuzl/). I previously earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at the [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. 


My research interest includes *Formal Verification for Software and Hardware Programs*, and *Large Language Model assisted Formal Methods*.
